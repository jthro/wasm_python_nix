# WASM_python_nix
Simple flake to get you started with a pygame project targeting WASM

## Motivation
itch.io recently added WASM support, and a lot of people like pygame.

## Usage
`nix develop -c $SHELL` when in the directory.

Credit to https://www.pygame.org/docs/ for the example pygame project.
